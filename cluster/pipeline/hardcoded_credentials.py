Hardcoded OpenEO Credentials

Simple file to store your OpenEO authentication credentials.
Edit the values below with your actual credentials.
"""

# Your hardcoded Client ID from the new OAuth client
OPENEO_CLIENT_ID = "sh-709a7af8-09ba-46e8-bcfc-f4d0d20461d4"

# Your hardcoded Client Secret from the new OAuth client
OPENEO_CLIENT_SECRET = "v9dPYitFLccIhtRohuIrvT0EwnsiJUIJ"  # KEEP THIS SECRET!

# If you want to store a refresh token manually, put it here
OPENEO_REFRESH_TOKEN = None  # Set to your refresh token string if you have one

# Instructions:
# 1. The Client ID is already set from your OpenEO Federation application
# 2. For Client Secret: This might not be available for your application type
# 3. For Refresh Token: You can manually extract it after authentication
# 4. If both are None, the system will use Device Flow (shows URL + code)
